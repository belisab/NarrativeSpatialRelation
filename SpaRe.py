The program locates Spatial Relation (SpaRe) in a text and creates a
visualisation of the frequency distribution of Spatial Indicators.

Excel file: AliceSpReCh1.xlsx
    The Excel file AliceSpReCh1.xlsx contains snippets from the text
    that indicate SpaRe. For the purposes of this study SpaRe was defined as
    instances where Spatial Indicators (SpIns) occur and are evidently linked
    to space and place. The data was cleaned manually.

SpIns:
    back, across, against, along, around, at, behind, below, besides, by, down,
    from, in, into, near, of, off, on, out, outside, over, through, to,
    towards, under, underneath, up, here, there

Linguistics and Semantics of SpaRe:
    The instances of SpIns that were judged as referring to SpaRe are
    prepositions that are part of prepositional phrases or phrasal verbs.
    Additionally, the demonstratives 'here' and 'there' were also considered as
    referring to SpaRe.
