Space and time are dimensions that do not exist without the other. This is also reflected in the stories we tell and understand. In this project, digital methods were applied to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll for extracting and analysing expressions that indicate spatial relation in narrative.
The project includes the following files:

ProjectDocumentation.pdf
-- Contains the whole documentation of research questions, data processing, and results.

AliceCH1.txt
-- Contains the first chapter from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. The text is from Project Gutenberg at https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11. See 'ParatextAlice.txt' for further information and license.

SpaRe.py
-- A code for locating Spatial Relation (SpaRe) in a text and creating a visualisation of the frequency distribution of Spatial Indicators.

AliceSpReCh1.xlsx
-- The Excel file contains snippets from the text that indicate SpaRe. For the purposes of this study SpaRe was defined as instances where Spatial Indicators (SpIns) occur and are evidently linked to space and place. The data was cleaned manually.

SpatialRelationsDictionary.ykd
-- Self-created dictionary for the program Yoshikoder.

ParatextAlice.txt
